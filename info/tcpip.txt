Transission Control Protocol and IP protocol
Whereas te OSI Reference Model is conceptual. the TCP/IP stack is used to
	transfer data in production networks. TCP/IP is also layered but
	does not use all of the OSI layers, though the layers are equiva
	lent in operation and function.

OSI MODEL:		|	TCP/IP Stack
1. Application		|	1. Application
2. Presentation		|
3. Session		|
4. Transport		|	2. Transport
5. Network		|	3. Internet
6. Data Link		|	4a Network access
7. Physical		|	4b Network access

Layer 7 - application
Layer 6 - presentation
Layer 5 - session
Layer 4 - transport - includes TCP/UDP/Port
Layer 3 - Network - includes 4 + IP Address - devices used: Routers
Layer 2 - Data-Link - includes 3 + Ethernet MAC - devices used: Switches
Layer 1 - Physical - all stuff as bits		- devuces used: Hubs

Host Communication Terminology:

Application	--> Data
Transport	--> Segment
Internet	--> Packet
Network Access  --> Frame


the transport layer
	- provides transparent transfer of data between hosts
		and is resposnible for end-to-end error recovery
		and flow control.
	- flow control is the process of adjusting the flow of data
		from the sender to ensure that the receiving host can
		handle all of it.

	- port number for transport layers is used to identify the upper
		layer protocol. For example, HTTP uses port 80. SMTP 25.
		The sender also adds a source port number to the layer 4
		header. The combination of source and destination port
		number can be used to track sessions.

session multiplexing
	session multiplexing is the process by which a host to support
	multiple sessions simultaneously and manage the individual traffic
	streams over a single link

TRANSPORT CONTROL PROTOCOL and USER DATAGRAM PROTOCOL
	- most common transport level (layer 4) protocols.
	- TCP connection is oriented, TCP-3-handshake SYN/SYN-ACK/ACK
	- TCP performs flow control
	- TCP receiving host sends acknoledgments back, lost segments resent
	- TCP carries out sequencing to ensure segments are processed in order

	- UDP sends traffic best effort
	- UDP is not connection oriented. There is no handshake connection
	- UDP does not carry out sequencing to ensure segments processing orded
	- UDP hosts does not send acknoledgements back to sender
	- UDP does not perform flow control
	- UDP error detection and recovery are provided by upper layers

Common applications and their destination ports:
TCP
- FTP (21)
- SSH (22)
- Telnet (23)
- HTTP (80)
- HTTPS (443)
- DNS (53)

UDP
- TFTP (69)
- SNMP (161)
- DNS (53)


THE NETWORK LAYER
	- routing packets to their destination and for Quality of Service
	- IP (internet protocol) - IPv4 / IPv6 are common case (also IPsec)
	- connectionless protocol with acknojedgements at layer 3
	- other layer 3 protocol - ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)
	- addressing is a logical addressing scheme implemented at layer 3
	- the network designer uses IP addressing for nets/subnets
	- layer 2 MAC adresses use one big flat addressing scheme, there is
		no logical separation between networks at layer 2, it`s on 3rd

IPv4 Addresses:
	- an IPv4 address is 32 bits long
	- it is written as 4 'octets' in dotted decimal formal
		for example, 192.168.10.15
	- each octet is 8 bits long (4 x 8 = 32)
	- the IP address is usually set manually on servers, printers, network
		devices suck as routers and switches. It is usually assigned
		automatically through the DHCP protocol on desktop computers
		(Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol).
	- to understand how the logical separation between subnet works, you
		need to understand the IP address in binary (see documentation)

Subnet masks:
to set the boundary between logical network (subnets), the IP address is combined
with a subnet mask. A host can send traffic directly to another host on the same
subnet via switches. For a host to send traffic to another host in a different
subnet, it must be forwarded by a router.
The host therefore needs to understand if the destination is on the same or a
different subnet in order to know how to send it - for this the subnetmask used.
subnetmask is also 32 bits long and can be written in  dottent decimal or slash
notation. A host`s IP address is divided into a network portion and a host portion.'
The subnet mask defines where the boundary is.

Ex...
Host`s IP address is 192.168.10.15 and its subnetmask is 255.255.255.0
So we have 192.168.10.15 / 255.255.255.0 - host`s addresses are 192.168.10
				local target address is .15 - send directly
